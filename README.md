## Why tRPC?
tRPC, a TypeScript implementation of RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is a protocol for running remote TypeScript code, through HTTP. Unlike GraphQL, tRPC is NOT a schema, it does not define communication types, 

## Setup

You will need to have node and PostgreSQL in your machine. 

1. Make sure you have **psql** and **npm** installed.
2. Create a DB with a name of your choice.
3. Create a .env file inside `/server`, with variables according to `/server/src/environment.d.ts.`
4. `cd` into `/client` and run `npm install`.
5. Same for `/server`.
